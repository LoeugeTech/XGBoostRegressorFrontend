## Description
The Streamlit application provides an interactive web interface for predicting insurance costs based on user inputs. The prediction model uses a machine learning model served by a FastAPI backend, which processes inputs such as:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Number of Children
- Smoker Status
- Region

The Streamlit app fetches metadata (labels and encoding) for sex, smoker, and region from the FastAPI backend and uses it to populate input fields dynamically.

## Requirements
To set up and run this project, you’ll need the following Python packages:
```
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib
- numpy
- streamlit
```
You can install these dependencies by running:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project.
1. Ensure the FastAPI server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
2. Declare the base_url to your API in the .env file e.g. BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
3. Run Streamlit The Streamlit app allows users to input values and retrieve predictions from the FastAPI server. To start Streamlit, run:

```commandline
streamlit run app.py
```
The Streamlit app will open in a browser window at http://localhost:8501.

## Usage
Streamlit Frontend

- Input insurance features in the provided fields.
- Click the Predict button to get the prediction.
- The prediction will display predicted insurance charges.

## Streamlit Application

The Streamlit app provides an interface for users to input feature values and get predictions. When the Predict button is clicked, the app sends the data to the FastAPI server and displays whether the predicted insurance charges.

## Example Input and Output
Example Input:

Age = 45
Gender = Female BMI = 28.7 Number of Children = 2 Smoker Status = Yes
Region = Southeast

Example Output:

Predicted Insurance Charges: $17,900.55
